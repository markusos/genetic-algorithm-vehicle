**Bachelorâ€™s Degree Project: Genetic algorithms - How does its parameters affect evolution?**

**Abstract**

Genetic algorithms is a method to solve optimization problems by imitating natural evolution. In the work that leads up to this report we use genetic algorithms to solve a complex problem. The problem is to develop a vehicle that can get through a predefined obstacle course. The main part of this report is devoted to examining which values that are suitable to use on the parameters that exist in the genetic algorithm, so that it will be as efficient as possible.
